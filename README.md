Refactoring Stock Analysis
#Overview
This week we learned how to analyze a large dataset using VBA. Our goal was to perform a swift analysis on stock trends to see what the best opption would be for Steves' parents.  To best suit Steve I refactored the data to produce a faster result time for the analysis on thousands of data cells. Refactoring makes the code more efficient by looping through the code multiple times  in seconds.
## Results
In order to complete this anylsis I had to add and delete a bit of code to transition smoother through the data. i started by initializing the variable "tickerIndex" and setting the value to zero, Next I created a list of arrays to store data from the data worksheets. The list includes "tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices as well as tickerEndingPrices." This allows the script to loop through our data, pulling out the values desired. After it was ddone looping through I needed a way to see the changes and see the amount of time the script took to complete. Using blah blah blah

Through thhis analysis we found that DQ would not be a viable option for steves parents as they dropped 62% from 2017 to 2018. the best option for Steves' parents would be either ENPH returing 81.9% or RUN returniong 84% from 2017 to 2018. 
debugging cleaner transitioning code, cons are it can be trickjy using vba (Errirs
