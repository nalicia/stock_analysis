# Refactoring Stock Analysis
## Overview
This week we learned how to analyze data using Visual Basic for Applications. The goal of this anlysis was to uncover the best company to invest stock in. To best assist Steve I created a macro in order to reveal which stocks did the best between 2017 and 2018. In addition to creating this Macro i refactored the script to improve the speed in which we get the results of the anlysis. Refactoring makes the code more efficient by looping through the code at a significantly faster rate. 
## Results
In order to complete this anylsis I had to add and delete a bit of code to transition smoother through the data. I first had  initialize a variable that would pull the desired results from the macro.  Next I created a list of arrays to store data from the data worksheets. The list includes "tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices as well as tickerEndingPrices." This allows the script to loop through our data, pulling out the values desired. After it was ddone looping through I needed a way to see the changes and see the amount of time the script took to complete. Using blah blah blah

Through thhis analysis we found that DQ would not be a viable option for steves parents as they dropped 62% from 2017 to 2018. the best option for Steves' parents would be either ENPH returing 81.9% or RUN returniong 84% from 2017 to 2018. 
debugging cleaner transitioning code, cons are it can be trickjy using vba (Errirs
